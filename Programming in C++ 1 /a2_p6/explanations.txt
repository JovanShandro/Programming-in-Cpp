***Before reading the explanations below***
in the files testcritter.cpp , Critter.cpp and critter.h that I have uploaded in grader I have corrected
all the errors using the methods explained below as I wasn't sure whether we had to upload them this way or 
with errors but I corrected it as all the errors are listed below.

a)after commenting the "using namespace std" we get errors as:

1- 'string' was not declared in this scope --- we get this error as the string class is 
defined in the namespace std. We can get rid of this error by using std::string instead of string 

2- 'cout' was not declared in this scope --- we get this error as the cout method is defined also in
the namespace std . We can get rid of this error the same way using std::cout instead of cout

3- variable or field 'setName' declared void --- We get this error on the Critter.cpp class
as setName has a string parameter but since string is defined in namespace std and thus it says that its set to void
We can get rid of this error again using std::string instead of string

4- 'newname' was not declared in this scope --- We get this error again because newname is declared as a string reference and still
since we have not defined string , we can get rid of this error using std::string instead of just string

5- 'endl' was not declared in this scope --- We get this error again as the endl command is defined in the 
std namespace , to get rid of this error we use std::endl instead

6- 'cin' was not declared in this scope --- we get this error as again cin method is defined in the namespace std so 

7- 'name' was not declared in this scope --- We get this error as the variable name is defined as a string which 
is an object defined on namespace std so again to get rid of it we use std::string instead of string

8- 'getline' was not declared in this scope --- We get this error as the getline() method is defined on namespace std 
so again to get rid of it we use std::getline instead of getline

b)after removing Critter:: before the method setHunger in Critter.cpp we get the error
'hunger' was not declared in this scope --- we get this error as since hunger is a variable inside the Critter class
it can not be accessed as a normal variable but it need an instance of a Critter object . in order to get rid of this error 
we can either make hunger a public and static variable and use Critter.hunger instead of hunger in the setHunger function or
we can make hunger public and then add a Critter type parameter to setHunger and acces the hunger variable ( for ex. if 
we add Critter& c as an argument then we use c.hunger instead of just hunger) and of course we should remove the definition of the 
setHunger method from the Critter.cpp file and then add it to the testCritter.cpp file and then it will be perfectly fine.
